## User story

```jsx=
const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Header />
      <Nav />
      <About />
      <Experience />
      <Services />
      <Portfolio />
      <Testimonials />
      <Contact />
      <Footer />
    </>
  );
};
```

The code defines a single component App that renders several other components, each responsible for displaying a different section of the portfolio page.

The component App returns a layout that consists of:

**Header component** - displays the header of the portfolio page
**Nav component** - responsible for the navigation menu
**About component** - displays information about the portfolio owner
**Experience component** - highlights the owner's professional background and experience
**Services component** - outlines the services offered by the portfolio owner
**Portfolio component** - showcases the portfolio owner's past work and projects
**Testimonials component** - displays testimonials from clients and colleagues
**Contact component** - provides contact information for the portfolio owner
**Footer component** - displays the footer of the portfolio page.

By breaking down the portfolio into smaller, self-contained components, the code becomes more manageable and easier to maintain. Additionally, it allows for a more modular and scalable approach, making it easier to add or modify sections of the portfolio in the future.
